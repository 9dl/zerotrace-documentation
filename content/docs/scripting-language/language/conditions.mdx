## Conditional Execution

You can conditionally execute blocks or commands using `IF` statements.

---

### Syntax

```plaintext
IF "<value1>" is "<value2>"
<commands>
IF_END
```

- All commands between `IF` and `IF_END` are executed **only if** the condition is true.
- Both values must be quoted.
- Comparison is strict: values must exactly match (including case and spaces).

---

### Example

```plaintext
IF "admin" is "admin"
writeLn "Access granted"
IF_END
```
- The command runs because the condition is true.

---

```plaintext
IF "foo" is "bar"
writeLn "This will not run"
IF_END
```
- The command does **not** run because the condition is false.
