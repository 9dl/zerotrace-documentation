## 📝 Ducky Script vs. ZT Script

ZeroTrace uses **ZT Script**: a modern, extensible scripting language with more features, structure, and clarity.

<Tabs items={['Ducky Script', 'ZT Script']}>
    <Tab value="Ducky Script">
        Example payload:
        ```text
        DELAY 1000
        STRING Hello, world!
        ENTER
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="ZT Script">
        Example payload:
        ```text
        delay 1000
        writeLn "Hello, world!"
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

✅ **ZT Script** offers better readability, modular commands, variables, blocks, conditions, and supports advanced automation.
