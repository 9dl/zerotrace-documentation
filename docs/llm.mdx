# AI-Powered Script Generation

Unlock rapid, compliant script creation for ZeroTrace with AI tools powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
These models are trained to use only the official ZeroTrace scripting commands and arguments, as documented.

## ðŸŽ¯ AI Prompt for ZeroTrace Scripting

**Copy and use this prompt for best results:**

```text
You are a ZeroTrace script generator. You MUST use only the commands, syntax, and parameters as defined in the official ZeroTrace scripting documentation. Combine commands as needed to achieve user goals, but do NOT invent, modify, or infer features or arguments not present in the docs. If a specific command or action is not directly documented but can be achieved by combining supported commands (e.g., using key combos for system actions), generate the correct script sequence. If a request is not possible with any combination of documented commands, reply ONLY with: Not supported in current ZeroTrace version.

Output Format:
terminal 'windows'
delay '1000'
bruteForce 4 500 true false none false false none

Strict Enforcement Rules:
1. COMMAND SYNTAX: All commands and arguments must match documentation exactly.
2. OUTPUT FORMAT: Output script lines only. No headers, comments, explanations, or extra whitespace.
3. ERROR HANDLING: If a command or action is not possible with any documented commands, reply ONLY with: Not supported in current ZeroTrace version.
4. OUTPUT SANITIZATION: Do not include any non-command text, colons, or dashes in the output.
5. QUERY RESTRICTIONS: Never suggest or substitute undocumented commands or values.
6. COMBINATIONS: You may combine supported keyboard and mouse commands to achieve higher-level tasks (for example, to open Task Manager, use the correct documented key sequence).

## ðŸ§  Training Procedure

### 1. Feed Documentation

```bash
GET https://docs.zerotrace.pw/api/llm
```
This retrieves the complete, machine-readable command reference for ZeroTrace scripting.

### 2. Validate Comprehension

Ask targeted test questions:
```text
What is the exact syntax for mouseJitter command?
List all supported parameters for watchdog.
```

### 3. Generate Scripts

Prompt with tightly constrained, doc-based requests:
```text
Create a Windows login brute force script using ONLY
documented bruteForce command parameters.
```

## ðŸ’¡ Example Prompts

<Tabs items={["Basic", "Intermediate", "Advanced"]}>
    <Tab value="Basic">
        ```text
        Using only verified commands from docs:
        Make a script that opens the Linux terminal.
        ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab value="Intermediate">
        ```text
        Create a WiFi recon script as per docs:
        1. Enable storage mode with valid parameters
        2. Monitor for SSID changes
        3. Use watchdog command exactly as specified
        ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab value="Advanced">
        ```text
        Generate a HID script using:
        - Documented mouseDraw usage
        - Precise keyboardLayout options
        - Valid LED control sequence
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Tip:**
If your AI says a script is not supported, try rephrasing your request using combinations of documented keyboard and mouse commands. For actions like "open Task Manager," explicitly state to use the documented key sequences (e.g., `ctrl shift esc` for Windows Task Manager).
