Comments in ZeroTrace scripts let you **add notes or explanations** to your code without affecting how it runs. Use comments to make your scripts clearer for yourself and others!

## ‚úèÔ∏è Comment Syntax Rules

You can write comments in several ways:

1. **Official Comments**  
Use `#` or `//` at the start of a line
Use '//' for inline comments

```plaintext
# This is a comment
// This is also a comment
writeLn "Hello" // This is an inline comment
delay "1000" # Another inline comment
````

2. **Freestyle Comments**
You can write anything on a new line, as long as it **doesn't get detected as a command**.
For example:

```plaintext
This is just a note and will be ignored by the interpreter
```

<Callout type="warn">
    If your comment looks like a command (e.g., starts with known keywords like `writeLn`, `delay`, etc.), it **will be executed**. So, avoid using command-like phrases for freestyle comments!
</Callout>

## ‚úÖ Valid Usage

```plaintext
# This script prints a message
writeLn "Hello, World!" // Inline comment

// Wait before next command
delay "1000"

This is a freestyle comment explaining what happens next
_$VAR isAdmin = "true"
```

## ‚ùå Invalid Usage

```plaintext
writeLn "Test" This looks like a command and may cause errors
writeLn "Test" # This looks like a command and may cause errors
```

<Callout type="info">
    Use comments to make your scripts easier to understand. Official comments (`#` or `//`) are recommended for clarity. Freestyle comments work too‚Äîjust don‚Äôt make them look like commands!
