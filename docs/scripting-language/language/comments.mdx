Comments let you **add notes or explanations** to your ZeroTrace scripts.
They make your scripts much easier to understand for you and for others because comments are always ignored when your script runs.

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è How to Write Comments

**ZeroTrace supports comments almost anywhere, just like in popular programming languages!**

### 1. Use `#` or `//` for Comments

- You can add **`#` or `//` anywhere on a line** at the start or after a command.
- Everything after `#` or `//` is ignored by the interpreter.

```plaintext
# This is a full line comment

writeLn "Hello" // This is an inline comment

delay "1000" # Another inline comment

blabla // this is just a random note

// This whole line is a comment
```

---

### 2. Freestyle Notes

- Any line that **doesn't match a command** is treated as a comment and ignored.
- You can write plain English notes as long as you **don‚Äôt start with a command word**.

```plaintext
This is a freestyle note that will be ignored by the script runner.
Anything that doesn‚Äôt look like a command is safe to use as a comment.
```

<Callout type="warn">
    <b>Warning:</b> If your freestyle note starts with a command (like <code>writeLn</code>, <code>delay</code>, etc.), it <b>will be executed</b>!
</Callout>

---

## ‚úÖ Good Examples

```plaintext
# This script prints a message
writeLn "Hello, World!" // Inline comment

// Wait before next command
delay "1000"

This is a freestyle note about what happens next

_$VAR isAdmin = "true" // Variable assignment with comment
```

---

## ‚ùå Bad Example

```plaintext
writeLn "Test" This looks like a command and may cause errors
```

This is incorrect because the text after `writeLn "Test"` is **not marked as a comment** (missing `#` or `//`).
Always use `#` or `//` for inline comments after commands.

<Callout type="info">
    <b>Tip:</b> For best results and easy reading, use <code>#</code> or <code>//</code> for all your comments.
    Inline comments are fully supported put them after any command, anywhere on the line!
